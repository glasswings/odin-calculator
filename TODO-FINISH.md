# Things to do to finish the calculator project

-  [X]  Allow input of negative numbers using `-`. This will require a
   leading-minus mode and handling unary operators so the user can type `-(`
   and `-sqrt(`

-  [X]  Switch between `=` and `)` legends

-  [ ]  Remove the `|>` button. I'm not sure how I want to define it.
-  [ ]  But do special-case square-root in result mode.

-  [X]  Squash underflows to zero
-  [X]  Set maximum width of numbers

-  [ ]  Handle leading zeros in input mode

-  [ ]  Add cheeky modal for division by zero

# Things to do to finish the calculator project

-  [ ]  Allow input of negative numbers using `-`. This will require a
   leading-minus mode and handling unary operators so the user can type `-(`
   and `-sqrt(`

-  [ ]  Switch between `=` and `(` legends

-  [ ]  Remove the `|>` button. I'm not sure how I want to define it.
-  [ ]  But do special-case square-root in result mode.

-  [ ]  Squash underflows to zero
-  [ ]  Set maximum width of numbers

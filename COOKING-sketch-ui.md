# Branch sketch-ui

In this branch I'll sketch out the UI, which is needed before I can develop the
register layer.

The layers are (something like)
- UI - HTML, CSS, and a bit of glue
- register layer - takes care of editing/showing the number on the display. Generates the stack machine commands
- stack machine - respects order of operations, stores intermediate values
